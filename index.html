  <p>Hi, I'm Godstime Ezi but go by Times, a multidisciplinary creative with a passion for visual storytelling, user-centered design, and functional code. With a strong foundation in graphic design, a refined eye for UI/UX, and growing expertise in programming, I bridge the gap between design and development to create digital experiences that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and effective.

Whether it's crafting sleek interfaces, building user flows that feel effortless, or coding responsive layouts that bring ideas to life, I'm all about turning concepts into impactful digital products.

Let’s create something amazing—design that works and code that speaks.</p></td>
